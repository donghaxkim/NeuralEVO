# NeuralEVO

NeuralEVO is a real-time simulation where circular agents evolve over generations to find and eat food using neural networks. Each agent sees through a semicircular vision field, detects the nearest food, and decides how to move using its evolving brain. Fitness is based on how much food they consume, and over time, smarter, faster agents emerge through mutation and natural selection.
